Hello, if you want to run this code please follow the instructions below;
First of all, you'll need to download Xampp server and run 'Apache' and 'MySQL'.

1. Download and extract this file to xampp/htdocs.
2. In funolympic folder, you'll find a funolympic.sql file open it
   and copy paste the queries in phpmyadmin (database).
3. Now you can access and run most of the functions
   but you need to change some information regarding password reset.
4. For that part, I've used PHPMailer (download this) so you need a SMTP username and password,
   you can find more regarding this in youtube.
5. After you set your SMTP username and password,
   you must set recipients mail (same mail used in SMTP username).
6. Enjoy coding ! ^^
